This app performs multi-threading tests.  These tests are intended to test multi-threading
functionality, like spawning, cancelling, and joining with threads of different priority levels,
and synchronizing threads with mutexes, and semaphores.

The tests are divided into different files, with a description of each test at the beginning of
that file.

The file main.c contains the COMPONENT_INIT function that kicks off all the tests.
